- [x] Implement search result pagination
- [x] Add search statistics display
- [x] Enhanced search API with multiple modes
- [x] Advanced search features with performance tracking

### 10. Code Organization & Structure
- [x] Create proper folder structure (src/routes/, src/utils/, src/config/, src/templates/)
- [x] Split server.js into multiple modules
- [x] Add centralized configuration management
- [x] Implement proper logging with Winston

### 11. Development Workflow
- [x] Add ESLint and Prettier configuration
