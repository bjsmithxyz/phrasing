# Phrasing

A comprehensive collection of 15,000+ useful phrases for business, professional, and conversational use.

## Features

- **Dracula Theme**: A vibrant, high-contrast dark mode design.
- **Instant Search**: Powered by Fuse.js for fuzzy filtering across thousands of entries.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Quick access to categories and alphabetical indices.
- **Performance Optimized**: Static build for fast loading and low overhead.

## Restored Layout

The project has been refactored to restore the original layout of the [Phrasing](https://phrasing.azurewebsites.net/) site:
- Added a fixed sidebar for category-based navigation.
- Implemented category-specific A-Z links.
- Integrated the search bar at the top of the main content area with real-time result highlighting.

## Getting Started

### Local Development (Static)

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run build` to generate the static files.
4. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve it with any static server.

### Local Development (Node.js Server)

You can also run the Dynamic Express server:
1. Run `npm start`.
2. Visit `http://localhost:8080`.

## Deployment

The site is built as a static application, making it perfect for hosting on **GitHub Pages**.

To deploy:
1. Ensure `index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`, and `data.json` are in the root directory (generated by `npm run build`).
2. Push to your repository.
3. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings (Settings > Pages > Source: Deploy from a branch).
